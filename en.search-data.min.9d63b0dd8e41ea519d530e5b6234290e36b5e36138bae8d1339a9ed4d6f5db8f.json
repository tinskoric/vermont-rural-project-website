In that same year, out in the grand heartland of America, rural farmers of the Farmers’ Holiday Association revolted against the two calamities which had been biting away at their very lives. One had been slow, long, and painful, but perhaps manageable. The other was quick, agonizing, and unsolvable. One was market forces, the almighty invisible hand. The other was greed turned sour. What faced rural farmers at this time was a general decrease in key agricultural product prices, which had been ongoing since the end of the Great War and which hurt farm incomes, and a sudden collection on loans by newly desperate banks and bankers barely holding on to their own livelihoods after gambling the weight of the nation. That collection, often turned into repossession when farmers, already working with less than expected due to falling ever-falling prices, came up short.\nThere is a certain aesthetic present in contemporary critiques of rural American life. That of the sugary drink guzzling, Big Mac obliterating, personification of health complications working some kind of manual job in some kind of dying industry. It does not come from nowhere, many people eat and live lives just like that, but is that their choice? Do people live poorly because the choose to or do they live poorly because they are poor?\nhttps://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/article/9880/galley/118489/view/\rhttps://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/06/05/100755125.pdf?pdf_redirect=true\u0026amp;ip=0\rhttps://www.councilbluffslibrary.org/blog/farmers-holiday-strike-of-1932/\n⬅️ Previous Section \rNext Section ➡️\n\r"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/thesis/methodology/","title":"Methodology","section":"Docs","content":"\rMethodology\rThis project is the result of a series of surveys and interviews conducted over the course of two years within the state of Vermont in conjunction with data provided by willing third-party sources. An explanatory sequential design was employed across two distinct groups of participants. The first group, encompassed participants who were selected by convenience, asked to fill out a survey, and later filmed for an interview which included additional questions. The second group, encompassed specific participants who were sought out for their potential insight, asked to fill out the same survey, but later filmed for a longer form interview which included several additional questions. All participants gave prior consent to be filmed and documented during the interview portion for the explicit purpose of this work.\n⬅️ Previous Section \rNext Section ➡️\n\r"}]
