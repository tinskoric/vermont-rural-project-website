# 👋 Hello,

This website serves as a repository of my work studying poverty among rural communities in the state of Vermont. Read through what I have written , listen to interviews, or grab some data—do whatever. Please just do remember to provide credit if, on some off chance, something here proves to be valuable in your own work.

  <summary>Navigation Help</summary>
  
To start, find what you want along the column on the left-hand side of the screen. There are three drop-down menus, if you choose to read through what I have written, select the first drop down menu ("Rough Lives"). After doing so a table of contents drop-down should appear, along with a clickable link to download a full PDF of the paper. To begin reading, select whichever section you would like from the table of contents. On each page associated with the paper there are section navigation arrows to move between individual pages which will appear when you begin reading. When navigating between pages use either the arrows or the table of contents. Otherwise, all the other drop-down menus direct to single pages, so just select them from the column and you will be all set.
